This guide shows you how to write a scientific article using the LaTeX document
preparation and markup system. We emphasize typing commands at the unix command
line in this guide as a way for you to see what is happening under the hood of
the LaTeX engine. We provide some links to graphical interfaces to LaTeX at the
end of the document.
